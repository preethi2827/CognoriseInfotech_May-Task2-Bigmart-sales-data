- Descriptive statistics
- Identifying trends and patterns
- Visualizing distributions and relationships

The EDA process is documented in [eda.ipynb](eda.ipynb).

## Data Visualization

Data visualization is crucial for understanding the insights derived from the analysis. Key visualizations include:
- Sales distribution across different outlets
- Item sales based on various attributes
- Trends over time

Visualizations and code can be found in [data_visualization.ipynb](data_visualization.ipynb).

## Results and Insights

The analysis reveals several insights, such as:
- Sales trends based on outlet size and location
- Customer preferences for different item types
- Impact of item visibility on sales
